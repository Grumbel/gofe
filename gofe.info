Introduction
************

   Gofe is a simple front end for command line programms like tfmx-play,
mpg123 or xanim.

   It provides:

  1. an easy to use interface

  2. a more or less nice gtk interface

  3. shell scripts for tfmx-play, mpg123 and xanim

   The `makeinfo' and `texinfo-format-buffer' commands transform a
Texinfo file such as this into an Info file; and TeX typesets it for a
printed manual.
